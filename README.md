This serves as a showcase for one of the projects I completed while I was a Data Analyst Intern at Cognosante (June 2018 - August 2018)

Cognosante employs hundreds of seasonal call center representatives to take calls from customers who have issues regarding their 1095-A forms. They would transcribe/summarize their conversations with the customer and the issue woulde be resolved by other analysts. This project seeks to reduce the overhead cost of hiring and automate the process of classifying customer cases so only case resolution analysts are needed.

Various classification models were attempted and the final model was a 2 layer LSTM model.
